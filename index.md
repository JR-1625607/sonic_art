Since the start of human history we have had music ingrained into our very DNA. Its part of what makes us human. There have been countless changes to what we consider music, and a multitude of genres have evolved with us over the years. We are part of the century that has seen the most technological change to the way we make music, with electricity becoming our preferred medium of sound creation. Concert halls that once played host to orchestras and musicians have fallen out of popularity, replaced by dark clubs full of human expression, where often a lone human is responsible for the ebb and flow of the crowd in front of them. Our primal self is still being unleashed to the pulse of music, but in a way that matches the technological progress we have made. The instruments of old have been replaced by sub bass, complex synthesizers and mechanically relentless drum machines that lay a beat with precision no drummer could attain. 

House. Techno. Rave. 

These genres have become the anthem of the masses who make a pilgrimage to their club of choice every weekend. Some are sober, some choose to enhance their night with the aid of drugs. It doesn’t matter when we’re all under one roof raving. My aim through this sonic art project is to create a soundscape that conveys the emotion felt through a night in a club, from the highs to the lows. My aim is to record friends describing their love for raving and what draws them to the music and culture. I will also be taking field recordings that will juxtapose the electronically created sounds accompanying them. The soundscape will be made up of three parts, Come-up, Plateau and Comedown. I hope this soundscape will accurately portray the love for raving that is still present, many years after rave’s ‘heyday’.
