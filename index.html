<P>Week 1 – 28th January

<font size="12">I missed the first week back due to illness, however I made sure I kept up to date with what was presented in class by reading the lecture information and watching the supporting class material, which was Christopher Cox: History of Sound Art.<font/>
 <P>

<P>Week 2 – 4th February

In the second week I started to plan what my project would be. I wanted to potentially do something with field recordings, such as use the recordings to make a song, which I have seen producers do before. <P>
  
<P>Week 3 – 11th February

This week in class we discussed w<hat sonic art actually is. The question is hard to answer, but it got me thinking about what I wanted to do for my project. I have decided to create a soundscape detailing a typical night of raving, from beginning to the end. I plan on using field recordings taken from around Norwich and from parties with my friends, to create an emotion evoking soundscape. The project will continue to evolve over the next weeks. <P>

<P>Week 4 – 18th February

The weekend before I had been to a party with my friends and I had taken along a portable recorder that I had borrowed from the university media office. Over the course of the night I took several recordings of natural party ambience one might hear at any party, as well as several interviews with friends about what they love about going out raving. I got several good interviews and samples and have begun editing the samples in a logic file, for use in my soundscape.
