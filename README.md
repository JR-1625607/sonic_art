**Week 5 – 25th February**

I missed this week’s lecture but continued to work at home on my sonic art piece by creating my 10 keywords and my abtract which can be found below. 

_Abstract_
Since the start of human history we have had music ingrained into our very DNA. Its part of what makes us human. There have been countless changes to what we consider music, and a multitude of genres that have evolved with us over the century’s. We are part of the century that has seen the most technological change to the way we make music, with electricity becoming our preferred medium of sound creation. Concert halls that once played host to orchestras and musicians have fallen out of popularity, replaced by dark clubs full of human expression, where often a lone human is responsible for the ebb and flow of the crowd in front of them. Our primal self is still being unleashed to the pulse of music, but in a way that matches the technological progress we have made. The instruments of old have been replaced by sub bass, complex synthesizers and mechanically relentless drum machines that lay a beat with precision no drummer could attain.**House.Techno. Rave.** These genres have become the anthem of the masses who make their pilgrimage to their club of choice every weekend. Some are sober, some choose to enhance their night with the aid of drugs. It doesn’t matter when we’re all under one roof raving. My aim through this sonic art project is to create a soundscape that conveys the emotion felt through a night in a club, from the highs to the lows. My aim is to record friends describing their love for raving and what draws them to the music and culture. I will also be taking field recordings that will juxtapose the electronically created sounds accompanying them. The soundscape will be made up of three parts, Come-up, Plateau and Comedown. I hope this soundscape will accurately portray the love for raving that is still present, years after rave’s ‘heyday’.

**Week 4 – 18th February**

The weekend before I had been to a party with my friends and I had taken along a portable recorder that I had borrowed from the university media office. Over the course of the night I took several recordings of natural party ambience one might hear at any party, as well as several interviews with friends about what they love about going out raving. I got several good interviews and samples and have begun editing the samples in a logic file, for use in my soundscape. 
**Week 3 – 11th February**

This week in class we discussed what sonic art actually is. The question is hard to answer, but it got me thinking about what I wanted to do for my project. I have decided to create a soundscape detailing a typical night of raving, from beginning to the end. I plan on using field recordings taken from around Norwich and from parties with my friends, to create an emotion evoking soundscape. The project will continue to evolve over the next weeks. 

**Week 2 – 4th February**

In the second week I started to plan what my project would be. I wanted to potentially do something with field recordings, such as use the recordings to make a song, which I have seen producers do before. 

**Week 1 – 28th January**

I missed the first week back due to illness, however I made sure I kept up to date with what was presented in class by reading the lecture information and watching the supporting class material, which was Christopher Cox: History of Sound Art.
