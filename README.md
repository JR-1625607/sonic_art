**Week 11 – 8th April**

I have sent my feedback questions to my friends and have received three responses. The overall feedback was positive and they highlighted some issues I hadn't thought about when creating the soundscape, such as placement of the interviews in the soundscape, and what could be added to certain parts of it. 

Feedback 1:

A1: I felt a range of emotions that were mostly positive while I listened. Joy, excitement, and happiness were the dominant emotions I experienced. The positive emotions only tapered towards the last couple of minutes as I felt discontent and a small amount of sorrow for the soundscape ending.

A2: All three parts accurately represent the emotions of the rave they are trying to portray.

A3: If I had to make a change to the soundscape it would likely be changing the place of the audio of two ravers speaking to during the come up instead of the comedown, this is because people often talk equally about how excited they are for an event as they do the feelings they felt after the fact.

Feedback 2:

Q1: Definitely felt like that buzz you get before a night out/when it's happening. 

Q2: Thought the parts accurately reflected what they were trying to symbolise, I can imagine coming down and seeing the light start to come up on the last bit.  

Q3: I would possibly add more energy as the come up progresses? 

Feedback 3:

Q1: Latent energy and introspection throughout the intro, into a sort of dizzy euphoria which is followed by an alienating feeling when the reverb/discordant part starts. This is then interspersed by the calm and more hopeful emotions but doesn’t return to the earlier peak.

Q2: The come up is accurate with sort of a restrained feeling that then breaks through to portray the plateau of a drug-like experience. Sound is expertly used to create and separate each section, the tone changes especially during the ‘comedown’ phase which is at times unsettling.

Q3: You could’ve inserted more negative energy into the comedown section like an odd key or something to show the anxiety people often feel during this time. However, I like the use of real sounds like the motor and the phone ringing, which grounds the soundscape into a visceral feeling.

After adding my feedback and going over the final checks, my project is finally complete and ready to hand in on Friday. I have enjoyed this project as it has allowed me to explore an area that I love and also expand my knowledge of sonic art, an area I had never previously ventured into. I wouldn't change anything about this project if I had to do it again, apart from potentially rearranging some parts of the soundscape noted in the feedback.

**Week 10 - 1st April**

I was unable to attend the lecture this week due to illness, However, I have been working on my webpage and have sent it through to Krisztian for feedback. After inserting my header image into my webpage last week I wanted to finish the design aspect of the page this week. To start I entered my abstract I had previously written into the page, I wasn’t happy with the layout of the text so I used align="center" to centre certain parts in order to make them stand out. Once I was happy with the text layout I used iMovie to combine the rough draft of my soundscape with the background image I created last week. I uploaded it and then used YouTube embed function to embed it into my page. I ran into a problem where the YouTube video would align itself to the left of the page, which doesn’t match the centre aligned theme of my page. To fix this I added a (center) at the beginning and end of the iframe, which solved the problem. I also updated the code so that the video would automatically scale itself to the size of the webpage. After receiving feedback via email from the class, I changed some of the issues they had brought up, both in the text and the soundscape. I decided to fix the sound problems first, which were shortening some parts and lengthening others and also boosting the voices so they can be heard. I was anticipating there to be some issues with the audio because the version I sent was a rough draft with no audio editing. After this I changed the writing on the page, removing some parts and altering a few words to make some parts past tense. I also added a reference to the statement I made about music being part of our DNA, the reference is an article about experiments with sound and DNA.
My updated abstract is below: 
  
*Since the start of human history, we have had music ingrained into our very DNA.<a href="https://futurism.com/is-music-in-our-dna"> It's part of what makes us human.</a> There have been countless changes to what we consider music, and a multitude of genres have evolved with us over the years. We are part of the century that has seen the most technological change to the way we make music, with electricity becoming one of the most popular mediums of sound creation. Concert halls that once played host to orchestras and musicians have fallen out of popularity, replaced by dark clubs full of every form of human expression, where a lone human is responsible for the ebb and flow of the crowd in front of them. Our primal self is still being unleashed to the pulse of music, but in a way that matches the technological progress we have made. The instruments of old have been replaced by sub-bass, complex synthesizers and mechanically relentless drum machines that lay a beat with precision no drummer could attain.

*House. Techno. Rave.

*These genres have become the anthem of the masses, who make a pilgrimage to their club of choice every weekend. Some are sober, some choose to enhance their night. It doesn’t matter when we’re all under one roof raving. The soundscape I have created is titled "Rave Together, Stay Together", and is a portrayal of the emotions felt throughout a night in a club, from the highs to the lows. It consists of three parts, Come-up, Plateau and Comedown. The Come-Up is a cheerful tale of anticipation, walking down the street, headphones in, fresh out of work with a bag of cans by your side, ready to see what the night brings. The plateau is a darker tale, with pounding sub bass and sounds of the night echoing throughout, eventually peaking with the repeating rave stab piano motif seeing the night to its end. The comedown, a heartful reflection of the night that is tinged with melancholy.  The comedown features interviews I have recorded with friends, describing their love for raving and what draws them to the music and culture. The comedown section also features field recordings of birds that will juxtapose the electronically created sounds that appear throughout, and ultimately end the soundscape as a fanfare for the night's demise, a sound any early morning raver will recognise.  This soundscape will portray the love for raving that is still present within not only me and my friends, but across the world many years after rave’s ‘heyday’.

**Week 9 - 25th March**

After weeks planning the main part of my soundscape, I have finally composed something I am happy with. I decided to use a sample of an iconic rave stab, a sound that instantly transports you back to that era of rave. This repeating pattern is then overlaid with time-stretched recordings of my friends that I captured at the party in the previous week. These fade away and are then reintroduced with a sample of Jonny Banger mc-ing at his Mega Rave part 3. Jonny is a through and through raver so I wanted to use a sample of him in my project to add a level of authenticity to it. These sounds build up and eventually climax, where the third theme then enters, leading into the comedown interview stage of the work. My soundscape is now almost complete and I have bounced a test version for feedback in class. Keeping with the rave image of the project, I decided to create an image for the background of my YouTube video, that I will then later upload. I found an image of the classic rave smiley face and opened it in illustrator, I then made it a vector using image trace and set the background colour to the classic neon yellow that is synonymous with raving. With the background now complete I will use it next week for my test YouTube video. 

I have created 3 questions I will send to my friends about my soundscape, in order to use their feedback to improve my work in the future.  

Question 1: What emotions did you feel when listening to the soundscape? 

Question 1: Do the three individual parts, come up, plateau and comedown accurately reflect the emotions of rave they are intending to portray?

Question 3: What change would you make to the soundscape?

**Week 8 - 18th March**

This week has been comprised of planning my main act for my soundscape as I still haven't fully figured out what I want it to sound like yet. I have also been focusing on the layout and content of this logbook and GitHub page. I have used the simple page layout provided to us by Krisztian as I want to focus my time on creating my soundscape, however, I would like the page to be aesthetically pleasing. I created a header image on Illustrator using robotic text, which I feel compliments my sonic art nicely and inserted it into the page.

I have been researching the link between human evolution and music in order to aid the creation of my soundscape. After some searching online I have found a neuroscience journal that published an article titled "The evolution of music and human social capability". The article reflects my opinion that music has had a key role in our evolution, and is why music is still such a big part of life for many. This extract succinctly sums up my feelings on the matter:

"Music is a fundamental part of our evolution; we probably sang before we spoke in syntactically guided sentences. Song is represented across animal worlds; birds and whales produce sounds, though not always melodic to our ears, but still rich in semantically communicative functions. Song is not surprisingly tied to a vast array of semiotics that pervade nature: calling attention to oneself, expanding oneself, selling oneself, deceiving others, reaching out to others and calling on others. The creative capability so inherent in music is a uniquely human trait.

Music is strongly linked to motivation and to human social contact. Only a portion of people may play music, but all can, and do, at least sing or hum a tune. Music is like breathing—all pervasive. Music is a core human experience and a generative process that reflects cognitive capabilities. It is intertwined with many basic human needs and is the result of thousands of years of neurobiological development. Music, as it has evolved in humankind, allows for unique expressions of social ties and the strengthening of relational connectedness."

**Week 7 - 11th March**

This week I started to create the first act of the soundscape, the come-up. I wanted this part to represent the optimistic happy feeling you have when the day moves closer to the evening, and closer to you heading out into town. I used bright synths and a cheerful electric piano sound to convey this. These sounds are backed by the busy sound of traffic and the hustle and bustle of city life, and as the part moves on the sounds get louder as if you are walking towards the party to start the night. The sound is suddenly interrupted by a phone call from a friend asking if you’re on your way, and soon the music resumes its cheery sound. I am trying to plan the main act and the plateau, and hope to have something ready for next week. I have been reading several books on electronic music such as 'Mars by 1980: The Story of Electronic Music', which details the progression of electronic music over the years. I have also been watching several videos of raves on YouTube from back in the golden years, such as this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl4G7sjWKds.

**Week 6 – 4th March**

This week I have been chopping up the samples I captured at the party in the previous week and placing them in logic. I have begun to add the base sounds to accompany the samples and arranged them at the end of the piece, in the comedown section. This is because I feel the conversations I recorded are the kind of thing you would hear after the club has shut and everyone is making their way to the after party to carry on with the night. The sounds I have added to the interviews are meant to represent the feelings that start to creep up towards the end of the night when the tiredness sets in and the comedown starts. These sounds evolve over the course of this act and slowly ebb away at the end into birdsong, a sound that is all too familiar to any late night raver and one that often evokes a small amount of dread. 

**Week 5 – 25th February**

I missed this week’s lecture but continued to work at home on my sonic art piece by creating my 10 keywords and my abstract which can be found below. 

_Abstract:_

These genres have become the anthem of the masses who make a pilgrimage to their club of choice every weekend. Some are sober, some choose to enhance their night with the aid of drugs. It doesn’t matter when we’re all under one roof raving. My aim through this sonic art project is to create a soundscape that conveys the emotion felt through a night in a club, from the highs to the lows. My aim is to record friends describing their love for raving and what draws them to the music and culture. I will also be taking field recordings that will juxtapose the electronically created sounds accompanying them. The soundscape will be made up of three parts, Come-up, Plateau and Comedown. I hope this soundscape will accurately portray the love for raving that is still present, many years after rave’s ‘heyday’.

**Week 4 – 18th February**

I went to a party with my friends this weekend and I took along a portable recorder I had borrowed from the university media office. Over the course of the night, I took several recordings of natural party ambience one might hear at any party, as well as several interviews with friends about what they love about going out raving. I got several good interviews and samples, and have begun editing the samples in a logic file for use in my soundscape. I found it difficult to capture these recordings because people began to act differently when I had the portable recorder out as if they were now aware of what they were saying and doing. Some of my friends were very cooperative and I captured some amazing samples of what you might hear at a party.  

**Week 3 – 11th February**

This week in class we discussed what sonic art actually is. The question is hard to answer, but it got me thinking about what I wanted to do for my project. I have decided to create a soundscape detailing a typical night of raving, from beginning to the end, using sound and recordings to evoke emotions you would usually feel over the course of a night out. I plan on using field recordings taken from around Norwich and from parties with my friends, to create an emotion-evoking soundscape that will comprise of three parts: Come up, Plateau and Comedown. The project will continue to evolve over the next weeks. 

**Week 2 – 4th February**

In the second week, I started to plan what my project would be. I want to potentially do something with field recordings, such as use the recordings to make a song, which I have seen producers do before. I am also considering creating a soundscape using natural and industrial sounds to juxtapose each other.

**Week 1 – 28th January**

I missed the first week back due to illness, however, I made sure I kept up to date with what was presented in class by reading the lecture information and watching the supporting class material, which was Christopher Cox: History of Sound Art.
