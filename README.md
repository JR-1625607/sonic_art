**Week 11 – 8th April**

**Week 10 - 1st April**

I was unable to attend this weeks lecture due to illness, Hiwever, i have been working on my webpage and have sent it through to Kriztian for feedback. After inserting my header image into my webpage last week i wanted to finish the deisgn asoect of the page this week. To start i pasted in my abstarct i had previsouly written into the page, i wasnt happy with the layout of the text so i used ##align="center"## to centre certain parts of my text in order to make them stand out. Once i was happy with the text layout i used imovei to combine the rough draft of my soundscape with the bacground image i created last week. I upladed it and then used youtubes embed function to embed it into my page. I ran in to aproblem where the youtube video would align itself to the rugh if the page which doesnt matct the centred theme of my page. To fix this i added ##<center>## at the beginning and end of the iframe, which solved the problem. After receviving feedback via email from the class, i set about to change the issues they had brough up, both in the text and the soundscape. My updated abstract is below: 
  
Since the start of human history we have had music ingrained into our very DNA. Its part of what makes us human REF. There have been countless changes to what we consider music, and a multitude of genres have evolved with us over the years. We are part of the century that has seen the most technological change to the way we make music, with electricity becoming one of the most popular mediums of sound creation. Concert halls that once played host to orchestras and musicians have fallen out of popularity, replaced by dark clubs full of every form of human expression, where a lone human is responsible for the ebb and flow of the crowd in front of them. Our primal self is still being unleashed to the pulse of music, but in a way that matches the technological progress we have made. The instruments of old have been replaced by sub bass, complex synthesizers and mechanically relentless drum machines that lay a beat with precision no drummer could attain. 

House. Techno. Rave.

These genres have become the anthem of the masses who make a pilgrimage to their club of choice every weekend. Some are sober, some choose to enhance their night. It doesn’t matter when we’re all under one roof raving. The goal of this sonic art project is to create a soundscape that conveys the emotion felt through a night in a club, from the highs to the lows. My aim was to record friends describing their love for raving and what draws them to the music and culture. I have also been taking field recordings that will juxtapose the electronically created sounds accompanying them. The soundscape will be made up of three parts, Come-up, Plateau and Comedown. I hope this soundscape will accurately portray the love for raving that is still present, many years after rave’s ‘heyday’.
 
 
**Week 9 - 25th March**

After weeks planning the main part of my soundscape i have finally composed somthing  i am happy with. I decided to use a sample of an iconic rave stab, a sound that instantly trsnposrts you back to that era. This repeating pattern is then overlaid with timesctreched recordings of my friends i took at the party in the previous week. These fade away and then are reintroduced with a sample of Jonny Banger mc-ing at his Mega Rave part 3. Jonny is a through and through raver so i wanted to use a sample of him in my project to add a level of aunthentocoty to it. These sounds build up and eventually climax, where the third theme then enters, leasding into the comedown interview stage of the work. My soundscape is now almost compeleted and i have bounced a test version for feedback in class. Keeping with the rave image of the project, i decided to create an image that i would be the background for my youtube video of my project that i will then later upload to youtube. I founf an image of the classic rave smiley face an uplaided it to illustrator, i then made it a vector using image trace and set the background colour to the classic neon yellow synonnamous with raving. Wi the background now comepelte i will use it next week for my text youtube video. 

**Week 8 - 18th March**

This week has been comprised of planning my main act for my soundscape as i still havnt fully figured out what i want it to sound like yet. I have also been focusing on the layout and content of this logbook and github page. I have used the simple page layout provided to us by Krisztian as i want to ficus my time on creating my soundscape, however i would like the page to be asthetocally pleasing. I created a header image on Illustrator using robitic text which i feel compliments my sonic art nicely, and instertetd it into the page. 

**Week 7 - 11th March**

This week I started to create the first act of the soundscape, the come-up. I wanted this part to represent the optimistic happy feeling you have when the day moves closer to the evening and closer to you heading out into town. I used bright synths and a cheerful electric piano sound to convey this. These sounds are backed by the busy sound of traffic and the hustle and bustle of city life, as the act moves on the sounds get louder as if you are walking towards the party to start the night, known as pre-drinks. The sound is suddenly interrupted by a phonecall from a friend asking if youre on your way, the listener removes their headphones to answer the call, and soon the music resumes its cheery sound. I am trying to plan the main act, the plataue and hop to have something created for next week. I have been reading several books on electronic music such as Mars by 1980: The Story of Electronic Music, which details the progession of electronic music over the years. I have also been watching several videos on youtube of raves from back in the golden years, such as this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl4G7sjWKds.

**Week 6 – 4th March**

This week I have been chopping up the samples I captured at the party in the previous week and placing them in logic. I have begun to add the base sounds to accompany the samples and arranged them at the end of the piece, in the comedown section. This is because I feel the conversations I recorded are the kind of thing you would hear after the club has shut and everyone is making their way to the after party to carry on with the night. The sounds I have added to the interviews are meant to represent the feelings that start to creep up towards the end of the night, when the tiredness sets in the and the comedown starts. These sounds evolve over the course of this act and slowly ebb away at the end into birdsong, a sound that is all too familiar to any late night raver and one that often evokes a small amount of dread. 

**Week 5 – 25th February**

I missed this week’s lecture but continued to work at home on my sonic art piece by creating my 10 keywords and my abstract which can be found below.

**Week 4 – 18th February**

The weekend before I had been to a party with my friends and I had taken along a portable recorder that I had borrowed from the university media office. Over the course of the night I took several recordings of natural party ambience one might hear at any party, as well as several interviews with friends about what they love about going out raving. I got several good interviews and samples and have begun editing the samples in a logic file for use in my soundscape. I found it difficult to capture these recordings because people began to act differently when I had the portable recorder out, as if they were now aware of what they were saying and doing. Some of my friends were very cooperative and I captured some amazing samples of what you might hear at a party.  

**Week 3 – 11th February**

This week in class we discussed what sonic art actually is. The question is hard to answer, but it got me thinking about what I wanted to do for my project. I have decided to create a soundscape detailing a typical night of raving, from beginning to the end and using sound and recordings to evoke emotions you would usually feel over the course of a night out. I plan on using field recordings taken from around Norwich and from parties with my friends, to create an emotion evoking soundscape that will comprise of three parts: come up, plateau and comedown. The project will continue to evolve over the next weeks. 

**Week 2 – 4th February**

In the second week I started to plan what my project would be. I want to potentially do something with field recordings, such as use the recordings to make a song, which I have seen producers do before. I am also considering creating a soundscape using natural and industrial sounds to juxtapose each other.

**Week 1 – 28th January**

I missed the first week back due to illness, however I made sure I kept up to date with what was presented in class by reading the lecture information and watching the supporting class material, which was Christopher Cox: History of Sound Art.
