**Week 11 – 8th April**

I have sent my feedback questions to my friends and have received three responses. The overall feedback was positive and they highlighted some issues I hadn't thought about when creating the soundscape, such as placement of the interviews in the soundscape, and what could be added to certain parts of it. 

Feedback 1:

A1: I felt a range of emotions that were mostly positive while I listened. Joy, excitement, and happiness were the dominant emotions I experienced. The positive emotions only tapered towards the last couple of minutes as I felt discontent and a small amount of sorrow for the soundscape ending.

A2: All three parts accurately represent the emotions of the rave they are trying to portray.

A3: If I had to make a change to the soundscape it would likely be changing the place of the audio of two ravers speaking to during the come up instead of the comedown, this is because people often talk equally about how excited they are for an event as they do the feelings they felt after the fact.

Feedback 2:

Q1: Definitely felt like that buzz you get before a night out/when it's happening. 

Q2: Thought the parts accurately reflected what they were trying to symbolise, I can imagine coming down and seeing the light start to come up on the last bit.  

Q3: I would possibly add more energy as the come up progresses? 

Feedback 3:

Q1: Latent energy and introspection throughout the intro, into a sort of dizzy euphoria which is followed by an alienating feeling when the reverb/discordant part starts. This is then interspersed by the calm and more hopeful emotions but doesn’t return to the earlier peak.

Q2: The come up is accurate with sort of a restrained feeling that then breaks through to portray the plateau of a drug-like experience. Sound is expertly used to create and separate each section, the tone changes especially during the ‘comedown’ phase which is at times unsettling.

Q3: You could’ve inserted more negative energy into the comedown section like an odd key or something to show the anxiety people often feel during this time. However, I like the use of real sounds like the motor and phone ringing, which grounds the soundscape into a visceral feeling.


After adding my feedback and going over the final checks, my project is finally complete and ready to hand in on Friday. I have enjoyed this project as it has allowed me to explore an area that I love and also expand my knowledge of sonic art, an area I had never previously ventured into. I wouldn't change anything about this project if I had to do it again, apart from potentially rearranging some parts of the soundscape that were pointed out in the feedback.

**Week 10 - 1st April**

I was unable to attend the lecture this week due to illness, However, I have been working on my webpage and have sent it through to Krisztian for feedback. After inserting my header image into my webpage last week I wanted to finish the design aspect of the page this week. To start I entered my abstract I had previously written into the page, I wasn’t happy with the layout of the text so I used align="center" to centre certain parts in order to make them stand out. Once I was happy with the text layout I used iMovie to combine the rough draft of my soundscape with the background image I created last week. I uploaded it and then used YouTube embed function to embed it into my page. I ran into a problem where the YouTube video would align itself to the left of the page, which doesn’t match the centre aligned theme of my page. To fix this I added a (center) at the beginning and end of the iframe, which solved the problem. I also updated the code so that the video would automatically scale itself to the size of the webpage. After receiving feedback via email from the class, I changed some of the issues they had brought up, both in the text and the soundscape. I decided to fix the sound problems first, which were shortening some parts and lengthening others and also boosting the voices so they can be heard. I was anticipating there to be some issues with the audio because the version I sent was a rough draft with no audio editing. After this I changed the writing on the page, removing some parts and altering a few words to make some parts past tense. I also added a reference to the statement I made about music being part of our DNA, the reference is an article about experiments with sound and DNA.
My updated abstract is below: 
  
*Since the start of human history, we have had music ingrained into our very DNA.<a href="https://futurism.com/is-music-in-our-dna"> It's part of what makes us human.</a> There have been countless changes to what we consider music, and a multitude of genres have evolved with us over the years. We are part of the century that has seen the most technological change to the way we make music, with electricity becoming one of the most popular mediums of sound creation. Concert halls that once played host to orchestras and musicians have fallen out of popularity, replaced by dark clubs full of every form of human expression, where a lone human is responsible for the ebb and flow of the crowd in front of them. Our primal self is still being unleashed to the pulse of music, but in a way that matches the technological progress, we have made. The instruments of old have been replaced by sub-bass, complex synthesizers and mechanically relentless drum machines that lay a beat with precision no drummer could attain.

*House. Techno. Rave.

*These genres have become the anthem of the masses, who make a pilgrimage to their club of choice every weekend. Some are sober, some choose to enhance their night. It doesn’t matter when we’re all under one roof raving. The soundscape I have created is titled "Rave Together, Stay Together", and is a portrayal of the emotions felt throughout a night in a club, from the highs to the lows. It consists of three parts, Come-up, Plateau and Comedown. The Come-Up is a cheerful tale of anticipation, walking down the street, headphones in, fresh out of work and a bag of cans by your side, ready to see what the night brings. The plateau is a darker tale, with pounding sub bass and sounds of the night echoing throughout, eventually peaking with the repeating rave stab piano motif seeing the night to its end. The comedown, a heartful reflection of the night, tinged with melancholy.  The comedown features interviews I have r
